Its goal is to help people become more informed about their health through preliminary self-diagnosis (advising medication and/or professional attention).  The user communicates with Alexa by voice and tells it their symptoms; the response contains their top three most probable illnesses and medication that can be used for the illness with the highest probability (above a certain threshold).  In addition, one has the ability to send emergency text alerts to key contacts in their phone in the case of a medical emergency.  Lastly, there exists the functionality to inquire about the usage, dosage, and purpose of several medications, such as advil, tylenol, zantac, and more.
